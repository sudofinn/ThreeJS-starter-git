# ThreeJS-starter-Kit ðŸ§Š
This is a starter repository for working with ThreeJS.  The app is build using vite. It includes a geometry, material,  mesh and lights as well as dat.gui.

## Usage
Use the code whenever you want. However, be aware that some of the code is taken from Bruno Simon and some of it from Fireship. Both have made awesome Three.js tutorials.
I combined the code to make something which truly works for me and I also added some features. âœ¨
